--Assignment: Homework Chapter 8
--Short Description: This SQL homework involves six exercises focusing on SQL queries to manipulate and format data from "Products" and "Orders" tables. Tasks include formatting prices, converting date types, calculating discounts, and masking credit card numbers. Each exercise is designed to practice specific SQL functions like TO_CHAR, CAST, ROUND, and SUBSTR for data presentation and manipulation.

3.Write a SELECT statement that returns these columns from the Products table:

The discount_percent column
A column named discount_amount that uses the previous two columns to calculate the discount amount and uses the ROUND function to round the result so it has 2 decimal digits
