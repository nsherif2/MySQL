Assignment: Homework Chapter 7 Part 2
Assignemtn description: This assignment involves SQL operations on the Categories and Products tables within a database. Initially, an INSERT statement is crafted to add a new row to the Categories table with a specified category ID and name. Subsequently, an UPDATE statement is written to modify the newly added row in the Categories table, changing the category name to "Woodwinds". Following this, a DELETE statement is executed to remove the added row from the Categories table. Next, an INSERT statement is formulated to add a new product to the Products table with specific details including product ID, category ID, product code, name, description, price, and discount percentage. An UPDATE statement is then composed to modify the discount percentage of the product added in the previous step from 0% to 35%. Lastly, a DELETE statement is devised to delete a category from the Categories table, but as this category has related rows in the Products table, a preceding DELETE statement is included to remove all products associated with this category to avoid errors during deletion.
